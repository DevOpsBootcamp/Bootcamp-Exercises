Python Basics
=============

There are two ways to run python code: 

1. A REPL (read eval print loop)
2. From a script

To open a REPL, just run

.. code-block:: none

    $ python
    Python 2.7.9 (default, Apr  2 2015, 15:33:21) 
    [GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

And some information about your python version
and other details should pop up.  The **>>>**
is your command prompt -- it tells you that python
is ready to execute your commands!

Your challenge is to open a REPL and:
#. Make a list of the months of the year
#. Print "<name> was born in <month" using variables 
   for your name and birth-month
#. Print the entire list of months, with a new line
   between each one, using a for loop.
#. Print all the months that start with "M"
#. Find the square root of 84

Even more of a challenge:
#. Generate a list of the first 10 prime numbers
#. Print your name to a file
