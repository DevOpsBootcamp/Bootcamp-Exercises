Testing Challenge Guide
=======================

* In general you'll be using the python `unit test library <https://docs.python.org/dev/library/unittest.html>`_ 
  to write unit tests in python.  Just add 

.. code-block:: python
    
    import unittest

to the top of your test script, and you should be good to go.

* Open up `tests.py <https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/Bootcamp-Exercises/blob/final-review/final-review/tests.py>`_ and add your own
  tests to test :code:`func(x)`.  You can follow the example, but
  make sure that the tests you add are still part of the ExampleTest
  class.

* For other tools you can use to write tests in python, check out
  `this awesome guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/>`_ on writing tests in python.
