Mock Interview Challenge
========================

With all your shiny new devops knowledge, you'll probably be interviewing with various companies
pretty soon!  Whether it's for a summer internship, an on-campus tech job, or a career after
college, interviewing well is an incredibly valuable skill that can open or close the door
of opportunity.  Having done a few interviews ourselves, we've gathered a few of the
quintessential interview questions for you to look over and practice with.  You can even
have one of the group leaders pretend to be the interviewer!  

First, a note about the format of most technical interviews: the process differs from 
company to company, but everywhere you interview will want to do some kind of technical
interview. Usually this involves a phone-interview and a shared document -- an engineer
from the company will call you and ask you technical questions, and you'll write 
code (or psuedo-code) in the document that both of you can see.  Some companies will
have you take a test instead of a phone-interview, others will simply ask for code samples,
but more than likely you're going to be coding on the fly.  That's why quite a few
of the interview questions below are technical!  

You might also take a look at `Google's technical interview preparation guide <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_6c6eu1oaDcJeKGcu43wtal8OeFNL6xMmmoSiDt9l5A/edit#slide=id.g2ae499219_057>`_
-- it provides some interesting tips, topics, and expectations from the mother of all
interviewers.

Interview Questions:
--------------------

1. What's a notable project you've worked on?  What were some challenges you faced in developing it?  How did you deal with them?
2. Why did you apply to $company?  What appeals to you about working here?
3. What's your greatest strength as a programmer?  What's your greatest weakness?
4. Write a brief program to reverse the order of a string (in any language).  For instance, YourFunction("abcde") should return "edcba". 
5. Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 100 (in any language).  Now rewrite it so that for all multiples of 5 it prints "fizz" instead of the number.
6. Describe, in as much detail as you can, what happens when you go visit a website (what steps does the browser go through to display the page?).
7. Write the code to control an elevator.
8. What's the difference between TCP and UDP? When would you want to use one over the other? 
9. Implement two algorithms that are O(nlogn) sorting alogrithms.  When would you use both of the algorithms? Discuss their advantages and disadvantages.
