Contribution Challenge
======================

This challenge is pretty simple -- contribute to a project you think is awesome!  It can be any
kind of contribution (even edits to the Readme), and any project.  If you need some ideas
for cool projects, you should check out `24 Pull Requests <http://24pullrequests.com/projects>`_,
which has a lengthy list of different projects that are looking for help!  A good place 
to start is usually to try setting up or installing the project -- did you run into any problems,
or find something that could be more clear?  Make an edit to the documentation, and boom, you've
got a contribution!  A quick reminder of the steps to contributing:

1. Fork the project using the fork button on github.
2. Clone the fork on your computer.
3. Checkout a new branch with your username in the title
4. Open an issue on the main project -- see if they'd be open to taking a pull request to fix it!
5. Make your changes and push them to your new branch.
6. Make a pull request into the main project from your fork.
7. If they need you to change more things, just push to your branch and it will show up on 
the pull request, no fancy changes necessary!
